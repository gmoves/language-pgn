This was my first outing with this opening and White has fallen into a small
trap. } 9.Qd3 $2 { A panic reaction. } ( { The obvious move } 9.Bb3 { to protect
b2 has what looks like a problem after } 9...Nxe4 { but in fact White need not
be too afraid of this continuation because of } 10.Nd5 Qa5+ 11.c3 Nc5 12.Nxc6

14...Qxc3+ $3 ( 14...Nxe4+ 15.Bxe4 Bxc3+ 16.Kd1 Qxa2 { would also win but not as
beautifully. I spent a long time checking the queen sacrifice to make sure it
was correct but my hand was still shaking and my heart pounding when I played
it. } ) 15.Kxc3 Nxe4+ 16.Kc4 Nd6+ 17.Kd5 ( { If } 17.Kc5 { makes the game finish
even quicker after } 17...b6+ 18.Kd5 Nb4# ) 17...Nb4+ 18.Kc5 Bc3 $3 { The key
move, trapping the White king in the middle of the board. White can do nothing
to stop the Black b-pawn delivering checkmate. } 19.Bd4 b6# 0-1
