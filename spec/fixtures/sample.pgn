{ A smooth positional crush by Hiarcs } 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6

13.Be3 { Hiarcs was still in book, but Black's response is interesting }
13...Bxc3 { Even for humans, judging when to give up this bishop is tricky }
14.bxc3 f6 15.Rab1 Nc5 $2 { Just a mistake. 17. e5 cant be that difficult to see } (
15...b6 16.Bc2 Nc5 17.Bh6 { is a possible line. I wonder if 17...e5 is good comp } )
16.Bxc5 dxc5 17.e5 $1 { Of course. a move that both humans and comps will play
effortlessly } 17...f5 $2 ( 17...Nxe5 18.Nxe5 Qxe5 19.Qxe5 fxe5 20.Be4 { I was
curious about this. } 20...Kg7 { That leaves the 4 rook ending } ( 20...Ra7 {
too passive - White can go a4-a5 and then turn his attention to the kingside } ) (
20...Rb8 { ideally, Black would like a rook ending } 21.a4 Kf7 22.Rd6 $1 { Thats
the problem, white isnt forced to take on b7 } 22...Ke7 23.Rxa6 bxa6 24.Rxb8 Bd7
25.Rxf8 Kxf8 26.a5 Bc8 27.h4 $18 ) 21.a4 { Even here, White should fix the
queenside and then attack on the kingside } ) 18.h4 { Black is lost. However,
its impressive how inevitable it seems with Hiarcs' play. } 18...Nd8 19.Ng5 h6
20.Nh3 Nf7 ( 20...Nc6 21.Re1 Rd8 22.Bc2 Qe7 23.g3 ) 21.Re1 Kh7 22.Nf4 Qa5 { I
think Bd7 and Rae8 should be played anyway. } 23.g4 Rg8 ( 23...Qxc3 24.h5 $18 )
24.h5 gxh5 ( 24...g5 25.Nxe6 $18 ) 25.Nxh5 Kh8 26.Nf6 { The rest is trivial.
Hiarcs makes no mistakes } 26...Rg6 27.f4 Qxc3 28.Qe3 Qa3 29.Rb3 { I would have
started with Re2, but comps control the tactics well, so they can invert the
order } 29...Qa5 ( 29...Qxa2 30.Qxc5 $18 { not difficult, but necessary to see } )
30.Re2 Rg7 31.Kf1 Qd8 32.Qxc5 Bd7 33.Rxb7 Rc8 34.Qb6 Bc6 35.Qxd8+ Nxd8 36.Rxg7

This was my first outing with this opening and White has fallen into a small
trap. } 9.Qd3 $2 { A panic reaction. } ( { The obvious move } 9.Bb3 { to protect
b2 has what looks like a problem after } 9...Nxe4 { but in fact White need not
be too afraid of this continuation because of } 10.Nd5 Qa5+ 11.c3 Nc5 12.Nxc6

beautifully. I spent a long time checking the queen sacrifice to make sure it
was correct but my hand was still shaking and my heart pounding when I played
it. } ) 15.Kxc3 Nxe4+ 16.Kc4 Nd6+ 17.Kd5 ( { If } 17.Kc5 { makes the game finish
even quicker after } 17...b6+ 18.Kd5 Nb4# ) 17...Nb4+ 18.Kc5 Bc3 $3 { The key
move, trapping the White king in the middle of the board. White can do nothing
to stop the Black b-pawn delivering checkmate. } 19.Bd4 b6# 0-1
